This bot goes through user-defined subreddits to look for mentions of your competitors, keywords important to your business, or posts by users you know are controlled by your competitors.

Different modes:
	- Competitor name search
	- Keyword search
	- User watch

In each mode you define a list of subreddits to search, and for user watch you can blacklist subreddits.

When the bot returns a valid target post/comment you can be notified via an email, posting to a slack channel, or saving the link in a text document.

Icebox:
    - Segnment user watchlist by competitors
    - Automatically add users to competitor list based on post/comment
